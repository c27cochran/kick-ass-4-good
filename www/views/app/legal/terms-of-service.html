                <p>The Site may provide links to Web sites maintained by third parties. Any information, products, software, or services provided on or through third-party sites are controlled by the operators of such sites and not by us or our subsidiary companies. When you access these third-party sites, you do so at your own risk.</p><br>
                <p>The information, products and services offered on or through the site are provided “as is” and without warranties of any kind either express or implied.  To the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
                We do not warrant that the site or any of its functions will be uninterrupted or error free, that defects will be corrected, or that any part of this site, including message boards, or the servers that make the site available, are free of viruses or other harmful components.  We expressly disclaim liability for any damages or injury caused by any failure of performance, error, omission, interruptions, deletion, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus, communication line failure, theft or destruction or unauthorized access to, alteration of, or use of record, whether for breach of contract, tortious behavior, negligence, or under any other cause of action. Each user specifically acknowledges that we are not liable for the defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of other third parties, subscribers, members or other users of the message boards and that the risk of injury from the foregoing rests entirely with each user.</p><br>
                <p>We do not make any representations or warranties about the correctness, accuracy, timeliness, or reliability of this site or third-party sites.  Use of any information on the site or third-party sites is at the user’s own risk. Under no circumstances will we be liable for any loss or damage caused by reliance on information obtained through the site.</p><br>
                <p>You must provide and are solely responsible for all hardware and/or software necessary to access the Site. You assume the entire cost of and responsibility for any damage to, and all necessary maintenance, repair or correction of, that hardware and/or software.
                Any financial information provided on the Site is for informational purposes only, and is not intended for trading or investing purposes, or for commercial use. The Site should not be used in any high-risk activities where damage or injury to persons, property, environment, finances, or business may result if an error occurs. You assume any and all risk for your use of financial information provided on the Site.</p><br>

                <h4 class="title">7.  Third-Party Sites</h4>

                <p>Certain sections of the Site may provide links to sites of third parties, where you may be able to purchase online many different types of products and services that are provided by third parties. We are not responsible for the quality, accuracy, timeliness, reliability, or any other aspect of any product or service offered or provided by a third party. If you make a purchase from a merchant on a site linked to by the Site, the information obtained during your visit to that merchant’s online store or site, and the information that you give as part of the transaction, such as your credit card number and contact information, may be collected by the merchant. A merchant that offers or sells products or services through the Site may have privacy and data collection practices that are different from ours. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information about a merchant, its online store, its privacy policies, and/or any additional terms and conditions that may apply, visit that merchant’s Web site and click on its information links or contact the merchant directly. You agree that neither we nor our affiliates are responsible for any damages that you incur, and you will not assert any claims against us or them, arising from your purchase or use of any products or services made available by third parties through the Site.</p><br>

                <h4 class="title">8.  Limitation of Liability</h4>

                <p>Under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, shall we, our subsidiary companies, or affiliates be liable for any injury to yourself or others, direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages that result from the use of, or the inability to use, the site, including its materials, products, or services, or third-party materials, products, or services made available through the site, even if we are advised beforehand of the possibility of such damages. (Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain categories of damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.  In such states, our liability and the liability of our subsidiary companies or affiliates is limited to the greatest extent that it can be limited under such state law.)
                In no event will we or any person or entity involved in creating, producing or distributing the site or related online services be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages arising out of the use of or inability to use the message boards or other interactive features, or out of the breach of any warranty.
                If you are dissatisfied with the site, any materials, products, or services on the site, or with any of the sites’ terms and conditions, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the site.</p><br>

                <h4 class="title">9.  Termination</h4>

                <p>We may, at any time and without notice, suspend, cancel, or terminate your right to use the Site (or any portion of the Site). In the event of suspension, cancellation, or termination, you are no longer authorized to access the part of the Site affected by such suspension, cancellation, or termination. In the event of any suspension, cancellation, or termination, the restrictions imposed on you with respect to material downloaded from the Site, and the disclaimers and limitations of liabilities set forth in these Terms of Service, shall survive.</p><br>

                <h4 class="title">10.  Other Terms</h4>

                <p>This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between us and you with respect to the subject matter contained in this agreement and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous agreements, proposals, and communications, written and/or oral. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you purchase and/or use the products or services of a third party that are provided on or through the Site. In the event of any conflict between any such third-party terms and conditions and these Terms of Service, these Terms of Service shall govern. This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. If any provision of this agreement shall be found unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The foregoing provisions of these Terms of Service are for our benefit and the benefits of our affiliates, third party content providers and licensors, and each shall have the right to assert and enforce such provisions directly on its own behalf. </p><br>
